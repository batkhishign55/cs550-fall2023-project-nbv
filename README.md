**DSC:**
A comprehensive analysis and implementation overview of the DataSys Coin (DSC) blockchain system. The primary objective of this study was to design, develop, and evaluate a blockchain infrastructure featuring key components like a validator, metronome, pool, transaction handling, and a wallet interface.

The project delves into the detailed architecture and functionalities of each system component. It highlights the validator module responsible for Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Memory (PoM) consensus mechanisms. Additionally, the metronome component, which orchestrates blockchain synchronization, is discussed along with its implementation details. The pool module's role in managing unconfirmed transactions and the wallet's functionalities, including key generation, transaction signing, and balance inquiries, are also covered.

The evaluation section assesses the system's performance, efficiency, and security. It includes analyses of throughput, latency, and scalability under various network conditions. Furthermore, the report addresses the system's resilience against potential security threats and attacks.

The study's findings reveal the robustness of the implemented DSC blockchain infrastructure, emphasizing its scalability, security measures, and efficient transaction handling. The project concludes with recommendations for potential enhancements and future research directions to further augment the system's capabilities.
